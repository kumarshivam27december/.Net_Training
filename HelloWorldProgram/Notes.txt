diff between core and framework
coi based application 
window gui based application / web application
services -> without user interface
web api 
console based-> mvc gui -> react -> web api ->Microservices
application interoperability (common language specification (cls)) 

->c# can use vb and viceversa
e.g System.Int32 alias of the both common type system used by both c# and vb  (common type system (cts))
(common language runtime) 
Sourcecode -> msile(microsoft intermediate language) -> jit compiler

dll(dynamic linking library) ->executable -> meta data all combine to make assembly which is stored or deployed inside webserver

manage code vs unmanage code
clr code in .net is called manage code
those who is not done by clr it have different executer , this are called unmanaged code


base class library(bcl)
predefined method grouped in called as namespace

value type vs reference type
variable are of two type -> 

data type 
user defined(stack delegate) vs primitive data type(bool int float)

Type casting
it take every thing in string format ->need to convert into other types as needed

arthimatical , unary , bitwise 

condition construct vs looping construct



4 types of looping construct
while 
do while
for loop
for each  -> forward only ->meant to work for arrays and collections
parallel for / for each


day 3
clr -> runtime environment (alternate to jvm in java)
