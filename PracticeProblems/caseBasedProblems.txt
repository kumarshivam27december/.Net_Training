Question No : 1 / 1
Task:
Write a C# program that determines if a given year is a leap year.
The program should prompt the user to enter a year, use control statements to determine if the year is a leap year, and print whether the year is a leap year or not.
Requirements:
•	The program should read a year from the user.
•	The program should implement the logic to determine if the year is a leap year using control statements.
•	A leap year is defined as:
o	Divisible by 4.
o	If divisible by 100, it should also be divisible by 400.
•	The program should print whether the year is a leap year or not.
•	Write the solution within the Main function in the Program.cs file.
Input Format:
•	The first line of input should be a 4 digit integer.
Output Format:
•	Print a message indicating whether the entered year is a leap year or not.
Refer Sample Output:
Sample Input 1
1999
Sample Output 1
1999 is not a leap year.
Sample Input 2
2012
Sample Output 2
2012 is a leap year.

Task:
Write a C# program that reads a temperature in Celsius from the user, converts it to Fahrenheit, and then prints both the original Celsius temperature and the converted Fahrenheit temperature.
Requirements:
•	The program should read a temperature in Celsius from the user.
•	The program should convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the below formula.
•	Formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
•	The program should print both the original temperature in Celsius and the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.
•	Write the solution within the Main function in the Program.cs file.
Input Format:
•	The first line of input is the floating point number.
Output Format:
•	The first line of output should be temperature in Celsius.
•	The second line of output should be temperature in Fahrenheit.
Refer Sample Output:
Sample Input
32
Sample Output
Temperature in Celsius: 32
Temperature in Fahrenheit: 89.6

Question No : 1 / 1
Task:
Write a C# program that reads a student’s exam score from the user and determines their grade based on the following grading scale:
•	Score ≥ 90 : Grade A
•	80 ≥ Score < 90 : Grade B
•	70 ≥ Score < 80 : Grade C
•	60 ≥ Score < 70 : Grade D
•	Score < 60 : Grade F
The program should use nested if statements to evaluate the input and print the corresponding grade.
Write the solution within the Main function in the Program.cs file.

Question No : 1 / 1
Task:
Write a C# program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user.
The program should continuously prompt the user for input until they enter the letter q to quit.
The program should perform the following:
Requirements:
•	Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.
•	Calculate the factorial of the entered number.
•	Display the result to the user.
•	If the user enters a negative integer, display an error message.
•	If the user enters any non-numeric input other than q, display an error message.
•	Write the solution within the Main function in the Program.cs file.
________________________________________
Input Format:
•	The input should be an integer greater than 0.
•	The input should be q to quit the program.
________________________________________
Output Format:
•	The output is to be printed as the factorial of the input number.
